    <p><em>* Note: Fabrication 3 costs are shown as $150K. This represents $100K for the tape out plus an additional $50K for fabrication expediting. As often happens on traditional designs. Expedite fees are used as a way to save 3-5 weeks in the fabrication process when the design is late to production. These expedite fees tend to be quite expensive compared to the amount of time they can actually save.</em></p>
