<h3 class="text-center">Via-Reconfigurable Full-Custom ASIC Benefits</h3>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-6">
    <p>The combination of full-custom circuitry with our patented routing fabric delivers powerful benefits. Both the interconnection and configuration of the analog and digital resources within your ASIC can be re-configured by changing a single via mask layer between the routing fabric layers.</p>
