<h3>What does the name THX AAA™ mean?</h3>
<p>The AAA in THX AAA stands for Achromatic Audio Amplifier.</p>

<p>Achromatic means “without color.” In the transmission of light, achromatic relates to a lens system that transmits light without seperating it into constituent colors. An achromatic lens transmits light without adding, attenuating or distorting the light. The light is transmitted with its orignal fidelity.</p>

<p>The short answer is an Achromatic Audio Amplifier transmits the original audio in its purest possible form without distorting or ‘coloring’ the audio.</p>

<h3>How did THX Invent Achromatic Audio Amplifier Technology?</h3>
<p>Audio amplifiers can be implemented with a variety of topologies. The Class A amplifier is a luxury. Class A amplifiers deliver great sound but they are big, expensive and burn lots of power.</p>

<p>People think Class D amplifiers are a recent innovation. Class D, in fact, goes back to the late 50s and 60s and the introduction of solid state technology.</p>

<p>THX requirements for ultra low noise, ultra low distortion, and ultra low power lead them to the development of a completely different amplifier technology. THX researched the ways an amplifier generates heat when playing music. They set a goal of developing an amplifier that was tiny, low power and still approached the audio fidelity of a Class A amplifier.</p>

<p>In 2006, THX started it’s AAA amplifier research. This research was not about reinventing the amplifier. Instead, THX focused on the shortcommings and physics of heat and noise generation in the amplifier and developed a technology to deal with improving both. A THX AAA can stay within a fraction of its low level distortion right up to with 1dB of the amplifier’s full output.</p>

<p>The AAA delivers 100x reduction distortion with major improvements in signal to noise ratio.</p>

<p>THX is about taking the listener or viewer as close as possible to the original. The craftsmanship that goes into a soundtrack is seldom heard by the end customer and THX wants to see how we might improve the transmission from source to end user to make that possible. The development of AAA was part of that vision. Deliver the performance of a Class A amplifier without the heat and weight.</p>
