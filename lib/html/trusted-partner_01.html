<p class="lead">Our customers trust Triad to be an integral part of their product supply chain. ASIC integration inherently reduces complexity by reducing the number of total parts but there is much more to our dedicated Operations Teamâ€™s value proposition.</p>

<h3>We start with a single part number</h3>

<p>Each Triad part number is unique and specially tailored for a single customer product. This 1:1 paradigm unlocks powerful supply chain control and Triad leverages it heavily. It means that there is never a risk of another company draining the global supply of parts or lead time constraints related to a catalog vendors production schedule that may not align with your production needs.</p>

<h3>We continue by optimizing your supply chain</h3>

<p style="margin-bottom: 3rem;">Through our network of approved suppliers, we can select production partners who are the best fit for the particular application. Each customer has different requirements and we are proud that our supply chain can support their specific needs while minimizing tradeoffs.</p>
