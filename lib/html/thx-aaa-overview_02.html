The TSTHX-88 also produces powerful performance with any headphone type, outputting a formidable 2.2 Volts rms into 300 Ohms and 2 x 63 milli-Watts into 16 Ohms. TSTHX-88 enables exquisite sound quality, smaller batteries, extended playtime and is perfect for products such as digital and wireless headphones, noise-canceling headphones, VR headsets, portable media players, and premium notebooks and tablets.</p>
