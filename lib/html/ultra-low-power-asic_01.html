<p class="lead">The wearable technology market is moving fast. Products in this category combine sophisticated electronics into small, light weight and power efficient solutions. A mixed signal ASIC is a great way to achieve your size, weight and power requirements for wearable tech.</p>

<p class="lead"><strong><em>Would reducing your wearable tech ASIC development time by one year help your business?</em></strong></p>

<p>Triad Semiconductor designs and manufactures patented reconfigurable wearable technology ASICs that will get your product to market a year faster and with a 70% reduction in development cost.</p>

<p>We combine mixed-signal IC design expertise, a rich library of circuit IP, and a unique and patented approach that delivers full-custom IC performance with rapid re-configurability.</p>

<p>Our reconfigurable ASIC approach means that you can create derivative versions of your IC and have new devices made in four weeks compared to the six months typically required for a full-customonly approach. Our customers are going from project kick-off to production in under one year using the Triad approach. The competition still takes two years to get typical full-custom only IC ready for production.</p>

<h3>Triad’s Rich IP Library Optimized for Wearable Tech Apps</h3>

<p>Our focus is on making high-precision, ultra-low power mixed-signal ASICs for our customers. Over the past ten years we have developed a rich library of building blocks and complete signal chains optimized for medical, fitness and wearable technology applications. Some of our IP useful in such applications includes:</p>
