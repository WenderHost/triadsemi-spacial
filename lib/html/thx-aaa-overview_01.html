        <h3>THX AAA™ Audio</h3>
        <p>The THX AAA™ amplifier is THX’s first foray into the arena of component technologies. It reduces harmonic, intermodulation, and crossover distortions by 20-100x for an unbelievably realistic and fatigue-free listening experience, and reduces power consumption by a factor of 10 for incredibly long battery life. THX AAA™ accomplishes this using a patented topology to cancel conventional distortion mechanisms and reduce bias current. THX AAA™ improves audio fidelity, shrinks battery size and extends playtime. The flagship THXAAA-0 amplifier boasts nearly un-measurable distortion of -137 dB, high output power of 63 mW, and only 5 mW of quiescent power consumption.</p>
