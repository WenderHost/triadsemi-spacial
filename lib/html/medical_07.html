    <h4>FDA Class III Medical Devices</h4>

    <p>A class 3 medical device is a sophisticated design and must adhere to the strictest quality guidelines because it poses the greatest risk to patient health. In addition to satisfying all of the requirements of a Class I or II device a Class 3 product must undergo a rigorous pre-market scientific review and FDA approval process. Class III devices are used to support or sustain human life making product malfunctions unacceptable. Products such as neuro stimulators, implanted defibrillators, and implanted pacemakers are examples of life sustaining class III devices.    </p>
