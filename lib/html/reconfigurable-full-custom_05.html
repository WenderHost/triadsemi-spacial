<h3 class="text-center">Our via reconfigurable ASIC methodology delivers significant time-to-market and total-cost of-ownership advantages.</h3>
<p>We utilize this portfolio of via reconfigurable tile IP (circuits, fabric and software) to rapidly assemble ASICs for your application.</p>

<p>Your ASIC will be an optimum mixture of existing Triad tile IP and new full-custom IP to satisfy the performance and cost targets of your program. Where possible we reuse proven tile IP to satisfy your requirements. This approach frees us to focus our design creativity and verification efforts on the most critical portions of your design that will have the greatest impact on differentiating your product in the market. This approach to ASIC design is fast, safe and highly profitable for our partners.</p>
