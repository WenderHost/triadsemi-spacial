<h3 class="text-center" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">For mixed-signal custom ICs, the real question<br/>is how fast can you get to second silicon</h3>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-6">
    <p>Upon receipt of first silicon, the customer discovered system issues that could not have been foreseen until the actual silicon was placed into the system. These issues required extensive circuit modifications. Schematic changes were made. The design was re-simulated. Next, the mixed-signal design was submitted to Triad’s ViaPath™ ViaOnly place and route software.</p>
    <p>The required circuit changes would have required three to six weeks in a by-hand, full-custom approach. ViaPath was able to make ECO or incremental routing changes to place and route the revised design in hours.</p>
    <p>Triad released a ViaOnly mask change to the foundry and new parts were fabricated, packaged and shipped to the customer in weeks.    </p>

      <p class="lead" style="margin-bottom: 0">Almost all mixed-signal ASICs need two to three passes to achieve production worthy silicon.</p>
    </div>
    <p>While digital ASICs often achieve first-time-right success, this simply is not the case with analog and mixed-signal custom ICs. Triad’s Agile Methodology reduces six-month respin cycles to 4 to 6 weeks.</p>
