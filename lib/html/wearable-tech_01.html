<p class="lead">The wearable technology market is a fast-paced market. As new products are introduced, the market responds resulting in rapidly evolving requirements. Companies looking to compete and win in the wearable market are faced with some formidable challenges.</p>

<h3 class="text-center">Wearable Technology Market Challenges</h3>

<ul><li>“Medical-grade” bio-electrical measurements at consumer price points</li>
<li>Low-power, battery-powered operation</li>
<li>Rapid time-to-market requirements</li>
<li>Ability to “fail-fast” in the market and iterate on the solution to satisfy emerging customer requirements</li></ul>

<h3 class="text-center" style="clear: both; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Why the Customer Chose Triad’s Hyper Agile ASIC™ Solution</h3>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-6">
    <ul>
      <li>The customer needed to get into an ASIC-sized form factor ASAP to get the product to developers. Due to the details of this particular application, the developers could not work with the device until the electronics were shrunk into a very small ASIC.</li>
      <li>The application had very high production volumes and very aggressive volume production price targets.</li>
    </ul>

      <p class="lead" style="margin-bottom: 0;">Typically, fast time-to-market and lowest possible cost do not go together.</p>

<h3 class="text-center">Triad’s Hyper Agile ASIC™ Methodology Delivered Fast and Cost-Optimized Production</h3>

<img src="{themedir}/images/asic_hyper-agile.png" class="align-right" style="width: 200px" alt="Hyper Agile ASIC" />

<p>The customer chose Triad’s Hyper Agile ASIC approach to meet these two seemingly incompatible requirements of rapid development and lowest possible production cost.</p>

Triad created a new Agile ASIC from silicon-proven Agile Tile IP™. Agile Tiles are full-custom, high-performance circuits that are enhanced with Triad’s ViaOnly™ reconfigurability. These Agile Tiles contain medium-grained and fine-grained design resources such as op-amps, buffers, capacitors, resistors, switches, transistor <p>fingers and logic elements.</p>

<p>Complex analog, digital, and mixed-signal circuits can be configured and reconfigured onto an Agile ASIC by making ViaOnly™ single mask layer changes.</p>

<p>Since, the Agile Tiles were both silicon-proven and ViaOnly configurable, we were able to assemble the customer’s new ASIC and release the base layers of the ASIC to the foundry long before the circuit design was completed. <em>Such an approach in a traditional full-custom-only methodology would be hazardous.</em></p>
