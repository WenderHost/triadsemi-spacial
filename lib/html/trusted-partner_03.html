<h3>Long Term Supply</h3>

<img src="{themedir}/images/hourglass.png" alt="We support long product/service life cycles" class="align-right" style="width: 120px;" />
<p style="margin-bottom: 3rem;">The vast majority of our customers have long product & service life cycles requiring supply for 20+ years.  In these life cycles, product obsolesce is a huge concern.  With our level of supply control & design ownership, theres no need to worry.  In fact for some of our customers, our involvement started as a mitigation of a critical part obsolesce from another vendor and now they are able to commission and maintain their products for many years to come.</p>
