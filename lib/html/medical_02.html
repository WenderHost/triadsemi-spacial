    <h3>Medical Device Market Challenges</h3>
    <p>Medical devices are often portable, battery powered and even implantable. Such device requirements place strong demands on product teams to reduce the Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) of medical devices. Consider these challenges common to the medical devices product space:</p>

            <p>Many medical devices must achieve ASIC levels of integration before the project can even enter trials. A large printed circuit board (PCB) full of discrete parts can be used for bench level testing of early prototypes. Unfortunately, attaching such a large device to animals or humans is unreasonable for even the smallest of studies.</p>

            <h4>The Problem with Early Integration in a Traditional ASIC Flow</h4>

            <p>While early ASIC integration solves the SWaP requirements in a project, device makers have been reluctant to go that route too soon in the development cycle due to the extreme cost and time delays associated with making changes to traditional ASICs.</p>

            <h4>Triad’s Reconfigurable ASICs Enable Early Integration and Rapid Prototyping and Innovation in Silicon</h4>

            <p>Triad’s reconfigurable ASICs enable single mask layer modifications to change any of the analog or digital functions within the ASIC. These single mask layer changes can be made in weeks versus the six month delay often incurred with the full custom approach. Only a single mask layer needs to be refabricated to make changes with no full custom layout required meaning that changes are a fraction of the cost of traditional approaches.</p>

            <p>With a Triad reconfigurable ASIC, when a design change is needed due to clinical trial results, new ASICs can be available within as little as six weeks. This rapid response approach is allowing medical device manufacturers to quickly iterate on a design and get to a device worthy of FDA approval a year faster than competitive solutions.</p>

            <p>Large medical imaging systems such as CT, PET and MRI scanners utilize ASIC integration to achieve higher resolution systems. High resolution scanners require more acquisition channels to be placed in the same physical area. When these scanners are physically large devices the area where multi-channel electronics can reside is quite constrained. The mixed signal circuitry for a single channel of a PET scanner can be quite elaborate. Attempting to place 32, 64 or more such channels into a constrained physical space requires ASIC integration.</p>

            <p>Triad has significant experience with developing multi-channel signal chains that achieve excellent per channel performance while minimizing cross channel interference.</p>

              <p>An MRI system involves processing pulse waveforms in the 60MHz to 130MHz range. These signals must be bandpass filtered and digitized with high-speed, high-resolution analog to digital converters (ADCs).</p>

              <h4>MRI Analog Front-End Electronic Needs</h4>

              <ul><li>Low power operation per acquisition channel</li>
              <li>The ability to filter multiple frequency bands</li>
              <li>Sharp, higher order filters in front of the ADC for noise rejection</li>
              <li>Support for non-ferromagnetic packaging</li></ul>

              <p>Triad’s Sampled IF ADC (SIF-ADC) technology combines a field programmable intermediate frequency (IF) filter with a high speed, high resolution ADC that can serve as an ideal MRI AFE. The Sampled IF (SIF) filter effectively looks like a FIR filter but implemented in the analog/RF domain. SIF filters can be reprogrammed in the field to create very sharp bandpass filters. The SIF-ADC provides 125MSPS analog to digital conversion at 14 bits of resolution.</p>

              <p>The SIF-ADC approach lowers overall power requirements, simplifies and improves anti-alias and bandpass filtering and allows for frequency agile filtering.        </p>
