    <p>TSMC is a world leader in pure play foundry services. TSMC supports Triad’s highest volume applications requiring deep submicron (DSM) process technologies (90nm to 55nm). The combination low power DSM logic densities with excellent third-party IP offerings and non-volatile memory makes TSMC a good choice for mixed-signal microprocessor-based applications.</p>

    <p>Headquartered in Taiwan, TSMC’s total capacity of the manufacturing facilities including subsidiaries and joint ventures, reached over 16 million eight-inch equivalent wafers in 2013. TSMC operates three advanced 12-inch wafer facilities and four eight-inch wafer fabs.    </p>
