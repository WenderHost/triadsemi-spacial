<a href="/working-with-triad-inquiry/" class="btn btn-primary">Find out if your company is already partnering with Triad &rarr;</a>

<p style="margin-top: 2rem;">We use a multi-factor verification method to insure that you are authorized to obtain such information for your company before releasing any information.</p>

<p>Our customers are often quite secretive about their development of an ASIC with Triad. ASIC integration is a competitive advantage for many of our customers. Many medical device companies are quite large so there is the possibility that we are working with another group within your company without it even being publicized inside your organization. We may very well already be on your companyâ€™s approved vendor list (AVL). Using the information request form above is a fast and secure way to learn who within your company is having success with Triad solutions and technology.</p>
