        <blockquote>
            <div class="content">After we started our first project with Triad, we identified another twenty circuits in one of our systems that could benefit from VCA integration.</div>
        <div class="attr">Senior Engineering Fellow<span>Fortune 100 Defense Company</span></blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <div class="content">We need integration to get our electronics into the small surgical instruments that we make. We are not IC designers. We needed IC integration, but we were on an incredibly tight development schedule. By using one of Triad's existing VCAs, we were able to go from project kick-off to working silicon in less than five months!</div>
        <div class="attr">Senior Engineering Fellow<span>Fortune 100 Medical Company</span></blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <div class="content">I would highly recommend Triad Semiconductor as a partner for the development and production of analog and mixed signal ASICs. Triad's entire engineering and management staff, sales and support team, and ability to meet promised schedule dates is truly excellent.</div>
        <div class="attr">David Bolden<span>PMP Project Manager - Sensor Group, MSA</span></blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <div class="content">In my thirty years, I’ve never worked with a better engineering team than the guys at Triad!</div>

        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <div class="content">I wrote an internal white paper telling my company how we could differentiate and innovate in our increasingly competitive market by using Triad’s VCA hardware and software solutions.</div>

            <div class="content">
                If we have William Farlow* on our project why would we ever want to attempt a project like this by ourselves?

        We are are extremely proud of our customer endorsements and it is our commitment to earn every one of them. We cannot publicly identify most of our customers. In fact, most of Triad’s customers consider working with us as a competitive advantage and trade secret in their markets. We do not publicly identify specific customers and applications unless the customer grants Triad such permission.</p>
